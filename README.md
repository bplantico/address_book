# ADDRESS BOOK

Welcome to Address Book, a simple web application written in Flask/Python by Brian Plantico. This is my first time using Flask (and Python in a capacity that wasn't 'FizzBuzz').

# Setup and Configuration

1. Fork this repository, then clone it to your local machine.
1. Open the repository in your text editor of choice.
1. From your terminal/command line interface (CLI), run `source venv/bin/activate` to activate a Flask/Python environment to run the application in.
1. From your terminal/cli, run: `flask db init`, `flask db migrate`, `flask db upgrade` in order to create your database and table(s).
1. You can now run `flask run` from your command line and navigate to the application on your localhost:5000 in your browser of choice.
1. Have fun!

# Schema
